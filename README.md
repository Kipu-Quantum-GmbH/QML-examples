# QML Examples

The idea is to provide some guidelines for those starting with QML and how this could be used in realistic contexts.

Please, make sure you create a virtual environment and install the dependencies at _requirementx.txt_. A simple way to do this is creating and activating the environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

and then install those dependencies by calling

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you use PDM or other dependency managers, the _pyproject.toml_ file should help you seting the environment ready.
